### Wireframes

## Features

### Existing features

Navbar: A Bootstrap code was used with jQuery added to make the navbar responsive. The color is the same red as the main color
of Time Magazine. I also enlarged the text and made it white, to stand out. I also centered the text to add style.

The introductory text gives the site user a brief note on what the Person of the Year award is, what Time Magazine is and a little about
the make-up of the award and how it's changed over the years.

The headers are used to signify what type of chart is below and what it relates to.

Honor pie chart: This pie chart features all the honors given to subjects over the years in the Person of the Year award. Site users
can click on a color to see how many people won the award, when and from where they came from.

Country pie chart: This pie chart features all the countries that won - it determines how many countries won the award multiple times.
You can click on a pie slice to find out the number of times a country won and it filters the other charts.

Category bar chart: This bar chart shows all the categories that have won. For example, you can see that the people who won in the name
of politics greatly exceeds other categories. You can click on the bar chart to filter the other charts.

Select menu: You can choose a year between 1927 - 2018 to find who won that year. Selecting a year filters the other charts and it 
complements the table underneath it.

Table: The table of data shows all the information that is available in the data set. When you click on any chart on the Dash page,
the result of the choice will show all the data that pertains to it in the table.

The prev and next buttons allow the site visitor to see more filtered results if they need to. It's also great to have because you can see 
exactly who won the award year by year without having to continous scroll down through data.

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

Bootswatch: The Journal template was used initially to start with as it provided a nice base for my project. However, I've added some of
my own CSS code from various places like Stack Overflow, CSS Tricks and Bootstrap.

DC: DC's library of code was used to make the charts. I took the code from the website and then charged dimensions, numbers and 
attributes to suit my needs for those charts.
