                        Time's most famous feature throughout its history has been the annual "Person of the Year" (formerly "Man of the Year") cover story, in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over
                        the past 12 months.
                        <br>
                        <br> The distinction is supposed to go to the person who, "for good or ill", has most affected the course of the year; it is, therefore, not necessarily an honor or a reward. In the past, such figures as Adolf Hitler and Joseph
                        Stalin have been Man of the Year. In 2006, Person of the Year was designated as "You", a move that was met with split reviews. Some thought the concept was creative; others wanted an actual person of the year. In 2017, Time named
                        The Silence Breakers, women and men who came forward with personal stories of sexual harassment, as Person of the Year.
